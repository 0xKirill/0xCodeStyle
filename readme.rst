Code lay-out
============
Indentation:

    - use 4 spaces per indentation level for Python code
    - use 2 spaces per indentation level for HTML code
    - use 8 spaces per indentation level for CSS code
    - continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent
    - when using a hanging indent the following considerations should be applied; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line::

        # Aligned with opening delimiter
        foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                                 var_three, var_four)

        # More indentation included to distinguish this from the rest.
        def long_function_name(
                var_one, var_two, var_three,
                var_four):
            print(var_one)


Maximum Line Length:

    - limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters
    - the preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces
    - the preferred place to break around a binary operator is after the operator, not before it
    - avoid backslash line continuation


Blank Lines:

    - separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines
    - method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line
    - extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions
    - blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations)
    - use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections
    - empty line in the end of file


Naming convention
=================
All identifiers MUST use ASCII-only identifiers, and SHOULD use English words wherever feasible (in many cases, abbreviations and technical terms are used which aren't English). In addition, string literals and comments must also be in ASCII.

Naming style:

    - **modules** should have short, all-lowercase names, underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability
    - **packages** should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged
    - **class names** use the CapWords convention
    - **function and method names** should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
    - **exceptions** should be classes, use the CapWords convention
    - **variable names** should have all-lowercase names, underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability (global_var_name, instance_var_name, function_parameter_name, local_var_name)
    - **global constants** are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words

Special names:

    - always use *self* for the first argument to instance methods
    - always use *cls* for the first argument to class methods
    - prepending a single underscore (_) has some support for protecting module variables and functions (not included with import * from)
    - prepending a double underscore (__) to an instance variable or method effectively serves to make the variable or method private to its class
    - for exceptions you should use the suffix "Error" (if the exception actually is an error)

Names to Avoid:

    - avoid *global variables*
    - single character names except for counters or iterators
    - dashes (-) in any package/module name
    - __double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ names (reserved by Python)
    - do not use Hungarian notation
    - avoid numerals in names

Names Abbreviation:

    - abbreviate each variable name to between 8 to 20 charracters
    - use standard abbreviations (the ones in common use, which are listed in a dictionary)
    - use every significant word in the name, up to a maximum of three words
    - remove useless suffixes â€” ing, ed, and so on
    - don't abbreviate by removing one character from a word
    - always use the same abbreviation
